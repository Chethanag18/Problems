Here I used the Python language to solve the problems.
Problem 1 (Calculator):Created a class called Calculator ,defined the methods within the class for each operation such as add, subtract, multiply, divide , each method should accept two double-precision floating-point numbers as input (a and b) ,
the operation type should be a string input indicating which operation to perform , return the result of the calculation and handle division by zero appropriately.

Problem 2 (Series Generation - Odd Numbers): Generate a series of odd numbers up to a specified limit.
Accept a single integer a as input.
Generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1, incrementing by 2 in each step.
Continue generating numbers until the number of generated odd numbers equals a.
Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.

Problem-3 (Series Generation - Selective Odd Numbers): Generate a series of odd numbers selectively based on the input.
Accept a single integer a as input.
If a is even, generate odd numbers until a/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
If a is odd, generate odd numbers until (a+1)/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.

Problem-4 (Dictionary Count of Multiples): Count the number of elements in a list that are multiples of numbers from 1 to 9.
Accept a list of integers as input.
Create a dictionary with keys from 1 to 9.
Iterate through the input list.
For each number in the list, check if it is a multiple of each number from 1 to 9.
If it is a multiple, increment the corresponding count in the dictionary.
Output the dictionary.
